# CHANGELOG

## v0.1.14 — Fix Debug Page E2E Timeout

Decoupled debug page rendering from external API calls. GET now only pre-fills the form and renders immediately; POST triggers the actual fetch. Prevents Playwright timeouts when external sources (crt.sh) are slow.

---

## v0.1.13 — Semantic Timestamp Elements

Replace raw text timestamps with `<time datetime>` elements on scan result pages. No formatting applied — raw ISO values displayed as-is, giving a semantic hook for future client-side localization. Removed all server-side and client-side date formatting code.

---

## v0.1.11 — Global Vitest Redis Setup

Added `vitest.setup.ts` to wait for Redis readiness before any test runs, removing per-file workarounds.

---

## v0.1.10 — Docs Consolidation & Date Formatting

Moved project docs under `docs/`, condensed AGENT.md to an index, added `formatDate` helper with tests.
